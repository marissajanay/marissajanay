## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my Master's degree in Library and Information Science. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning library programming and digital curation.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ideas of how to utilize my future MLIS degree outside of the classic Library setting.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with expanding my current rotation of go to meals.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my love for bad shark sci-fi films. Check out [Awesome SciFi](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome-scifi/tree/main) for some great recommendations!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: I'm probably sitting in front of my computer.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her
- âš¡ Fun fact: My inability to pick a decent film is so bad that I've been banned from making movie night suggestions. I pick great TV shows though!

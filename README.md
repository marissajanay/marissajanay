## Hi there 👋

<!--
**marissajanay/marissajanay** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on my Master's degree in Library and Information Science. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning library programming and digital curation.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on ideas of how to utilize my future MLIS degree outside of the classic Library setting.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with expanding my current rotation of go to meals.
- 💬 Ask me about my love for bad shark sci-fi films.
- 📫 How to reach me: I'm probably sitting in front of my computer.
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: My inability to pick a decent film is so bad that I've been banned from making movie night suggestions. I pick great TV shows though!
